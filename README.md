Screenshot of website: 

This website is a simple company website overviewing what the company does and can provide to their customers.

The entire website was made using non-semantic tags such as "div" and "span"
  
To increase traffic and make the site usable to those using screenreaders the website had a behind the scenes overhaul to achieve this.  
  note: the website to the regular user is no different. The code has been changed to include semantic tags without the site visually changing.  
  
#What was changed?
  
All "div" and <span> tags have been replaced with the corrent semantic tags such as:  
  "section"  
  "aside"  
  "nav"  
  "article"  
  "reader"  
  "footer"  
  "strong"    
  
An appropriate title has also been added for ease of use when navigating a browser "the name of the website has been used as the title instead of "website"
  
Alt descriptions have also been added to all images so that in the case the image doesnt load or the user cannot see the image, the user has an idea of what the image would have been displaying.
